Intent
======

* Establish a budget to sustain the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team
* Define a framework for the Core Team to collaborate within
* Deliver transparent communication of BitShares development efforts to the community

Background
==========

BitShares Core software is currently maintained by individuals either volunteering their time or
receiving funding through distinct short-term worker proposals. The BitShares Community has
recognized the need for organized development efforts to increase the utility of our platform.
There is a large backlog of ideas and requirements lacking prioritization, including feature
enhancements, bug fixes, and BSIPs. Therefore, proposed is the establishment of a long-term,
professional, global team dedicated to cohesive and comprehensive development efforts delivered
transparently.

Worker
======

This is a Budget Worker Proposal which provides funding through calendar year 2018 for:
* BitShares Core Team Roles
* Collaboration Tools

It intends to work in concert with the existing development resources including Abit, Alfredo
Garcia, and the UI Team, led by Bill Butler. BTS are collected into the
`"workers.bitshares.foundation"` account which is a multi-sig account controlled by
`"BitShares Blockchain Foundation"` and owned by `"committee-account"` using the Budget Worker
Model [5]:

* Transparent accounting provided by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [6]
* Submitted invoices reviewed, approved and remitted within 5 business days
* Compensation paid in bitUSD (according to the rules set forth in [5])
* All unused accumulated BTS returned to the Reserve Pool at the conclusion of the Worker [5]

Core Team Roles
===============

The BitShares Core Team is a self-organizing agile-principled team focused on delivering regularly
scheduled releases and ad hoc bug fixes for the BitShares Core software. The plan is to rapidly
grow into and sustain a dedicated team approximating the composition in Table 1. and representing
an **upper bound** on expenditures. The actual number of contributors and roles **may vary** within
each development cycle (described below), leading to variations in weekly compensation per
contributor. The team has discretion in allocating resources to meet the needs of each development
cycle. 

Producing reliable and secure software at scale requires ideation, organization, definition,
prioritization, development, testing and documentation. The ideal team composition includes roles
specializing in each of these functions and capable of contributing many. The goal of a highly
functioning team is to fully utilize each individual's effort and together maximize their collective output.

_^Hours for some roles are rolled up into a higher rate tier for budget purposes only. The result
may be more hours performed at lower rates._

* Development Cycles*:
  * Feature Release (non-hard fork):
    * Three-week sprints
  * Core Release (Hard Fork):
    * Twice annually: first Thursday of June & December

_*Subject to change upon consensus of Core Team Members_

Bounty Process (Implicit Budget)
================================

The BitShares Core Team will prioritize and estimate ad hoc enhancements into a _bounty_ for any
community member to _claim_. Compensation for the successful merging of code for a given _bounty_ is
drawn from the excess _implicit_ budget capacity within Table 1. when any Core Team Role is not
fully allocated. The specifics for the bounty process are still being revised (note: they are
largely based on those in use by the UI Team).

BitShares Core Team Framework:
==============================
Accountability
* Maintain timely collaborative communications with each BitShares Core Team Member
* Participate in at least two of three weekly Collaboration Sessions (see Coordinator description)
* Target a majority of your weekly hours between Tuesday - Thursday
  * Facilitates ad hoc collaboration
  * Facilitates healthy work/life balance

Transparency
* Maintain working increments within Community facing collaboration tools
* Maintain timely updates within Community facing collaboration tools of work in progress and development priorities

Delivery
* Deliver the highest value work first
* Favor release schedule over feature completeness (see Development Cycles)

BitShares Core Team Member 'Contract Work' Guidance:
====================================================

Duration and Pay
================

This proposal will last for roughly 45 weeks, starting from 20th February 2018.

Payments:
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work
performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain
Foundation for direct payment to Core Team Members
* Coordinator will review and approve vendor invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain
Foundation for direct payment to vendor

Calculation:
* 4.7524 BTS/bitUSD = Settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writing (2018-02-07)
* 2.5 = Collateral multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow with 2.5x collateral, as needed
* $6,410 USD/day * 4.7524 BTS/USD * 2.5 collateral multiplier ≈ 76,157 BTS/day

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [5].
